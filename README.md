# AnotherEntropyEstimationTool
Entropy estimation based on NIST SP 800-90B non-IID track is supported.

The proposed list of corrections to NIST SP 800-90B is drafted so that an entropy estimating tool for claiming conformance can be developed in a traceable manner, as shown in [/documentation/ProposedListOfCorrections_SP800-90B.pdf](https://github.com/g-g-sakura/AnotherEntropyEstimationTool/blob/main/documentation/ProposedListOfCorrections_SP800-90B.pdf) .

# Features
This tool can output entropy estimation results in a XeLaTeX source file (by using `-x` option)
