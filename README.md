# AnotherEntropyEstimationTool
Entropy estimation based on NIST SP 800-90B non-IID track is supported.
This tool can output entropy estimation results in a XeLaTeX source file.

The proposed list of corrections to NIST SP 800-90B is drafted so that an entropy estimating tool for claiming conformance can be developed in a traceable manner, as shown in /documentation/ProposedListOfCorrections_SP800-90B.pdf .
