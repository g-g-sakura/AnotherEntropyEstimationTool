\section{Introduction}
This list of corrections for NIST SP 800-90B \cite{SP80090B} 6.3 Estimators has been drafted so that an entropy estimating tool for claiming conformance can be developed in a traceable manner.

\section{Corrections to 6.3.4 The Compression Estimate}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Correction to step 4-b-ii

\begin{shadebox}
\begin{algorithmic}
%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%
\State If $dict[s_{i}]$ is zero, add that value to the dictionary, i.e., $dict[s_{i}'] =i$. Let $D_{i-d} = i$.
%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%
\end{algorithmic}
\end{shadebox}
should be replaced by the following:
%\\ 
\begin{shadebox}
\begin{algorithmic}
%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%
\State If $dict[s_{i} \textcolor{red}{'}]$ is zero, add that value to the dictionary, i.e., $dict[s_{i}'] =i$. Let $D_{i-d} = i$.
%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%
\end{algorithmic}
\end{shadebox}

	\item Correction to the expression of $G(z)$

The Eq.(\ref{eq:Gin634}) should be replaced by Eq.\ref{eq:newGin634}.
\begin{align}
G(z) = \tfrac{1}{\nu} 
\sum_{t = d + 1}^{L} 
\sum_{u = 1}^{t} 
\log_{2}(u) F(z, t, u)  \label{eq:Gin634}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
G(z) = \tfrac{1}{\nu} 
\sum_{t = d + 1}^{ \textcolor{red}{\lfloor L / b \rfloor}} 
\sum_{u = 1}^{t} 
\log_{2}(u) F(z, t, u)  \label{eq:newGin634}
\end{align}

This correction makes sense if the summation over $t$ starts from $d + 1$ then it should end at $\lfloor L / b \rfloor$.  Also the factor $\tfrac{1}{\nu}$ coincides with this argument as $\nu = \lfloor L / b \rfloor - d$.

The Eq.(\ref{eq:newGin634}) can be further rewritten to as Eq.(\ref{eq:rewGin634}), as $\log_{2}(1) = 0$.
\begin{align}
G(z) = \tfrac{1}{\nu} 
\sum_{t = d + 1}^{\lfloor L / b \rfloor} 
\sum_{u = \textcolor{red}{2}}^{t} 
\log_{2}(u) F(z, t, u)  \label{eq:rewGin634}
\end{align}

Note that the r.h.s. of Eq.(\ref{eq:rewGin634}) can be optimized further for algorithmic efficiency.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Corrections to 6.3.10 The LZ78Y Prediction Estimate}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Missing step

The variable $C$ is used in step 4 without its definition.  So the following new step should be introduced just before step 4, and steps 4 to 6 should be renumbered accordingly.
\\
\begin{shadebox}
\begin{algorithmic}
%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%
\State Let $C$ be the number of ones in $correct$.
%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%
\end{algorithmic}
\end{shadebox}
\vspace{5mm}

\item Corrections to step 3-a-ii
\begin{shadebox}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%
%{\let\fmtlinenumber\mathalph
\setcounter{ALG@line}{1}%
\State If $(s_{i-j-1}, \ldots, s_{i-2})$ is in $D$, 
\Indent
\Statex \hspace{\algorithmicindent} Let $D[s_{i-j-1}, \ldots, s_{i-2}][s_{i-1}] = D[s_{i-j-1}, \ldots, s_{i-2}][s_{i-1}] + 1$
\EndIndent
%}
%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%
\end{algorithmic}
\end{shadebox}
should be replaced by the following:
%\\ 
\begin{shadebox}
%%%\setstretch{1.35}
\setstretch{1.4}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%
\setcounter{ALG@line}{1}%
\If {$(s_{i-j-1}, \ldots, s_{i-2})$ is in $D$, }
	\If {$[(s_{i-j-1}, \ldots, s_{i-2}), s_{i-1}]$ is in $D$,}
		\State Let $D[s_{i-j-1}, \ldots, s_{i-2}][s_{i-1}] = D[s_{i-j-1}, \ldots, s_{i-2}][s_{i-1}] + 1$
	\Else
		\If {$dictionarySize < maxDictionarySize$}
			\State Let $D[s_{i-j-1}, \ldots, s_{i-2}][s_{i-1}] = 0$
			\Statex \Comment {With this step, the issue can be resolved that the value of $D[s_{i-j-1}, \ldots, s_{i-2}][s_{i-1}]$ is undefined, when $(s_{i-j-1}, \ldots, s_{i-2})$ is in $D$ but $[(s_{i-j-1}, \ldots, s_{i-2}), s_{i-1}]$ is not in $D$.}
			\State $dictionarySize = dictionarySize + 1$
			\Statex \Comment {The value $dictionarySize$ is equal to the size of dictionary $D$, or the number of ($\mib{x}, y$) pairs in $D[\mib{x}][y]$.}
		\EndIf
	\EndIf
\EndIf
%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%
\end{algorithmic}
\end{shadebox}
\vspace{5mm}


\item Column header in Example

Also the column header 
%``\textbf{Max} ${\mib{D}}[{\mib{prev}}]$ {\bf entry}''
\begin{shadebox}
\begin{algorithmic}
%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%
\State \textbf{Max} ${\mib{D}}[{\mib{prev}}]$ \textbf{entry}
%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%
\end{algorithmic}
\end{shadebox}
 in the table for \textit{Example} should be replaced by 
%``$\argmax_{y} {\mib{D}}[{\mib{prev}}][y]$''
\begin{shadebox}
\begin{algorithmic}
%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%
\State $\argmax_{y} {\mib{D}}[{\mib{prev}}][y]$
%%%%%
%%%%%
%%%%%
\end{algorithmic}
\end{shadebox}
.
